Once you get off the subway  it's about an 8-minute walk. It will take one hour door-to-door  but will only cost 2.40 for the entire trip. When we are flying out of Logan  we almost always take the subway ourselves. Ubers/Lyfts are 20-25 each way  but are admittedly extremely convenient.

TRAIN: Walk 8 minutes to access the MBTA Orange Line  Green Street Station  which will take you into downtown and beyond  even as far as Cambridge  MIT  and Harvard University.

9183638,Spacious Downtown Apt + Courtyard,Walking: The apartment is walking distance from just about everything in downtown Boston. Just remember to bring shoes you are comfortable walking in!  Public Transportation: The apartment is within walking distance of the subway  commuter rail and buses. The closest subway station is Tufts Medical Center Station (Orange line) and is about a 5 min walk. Other nearby subway stations include: -South Station (Red line  Silver line  commuter rail): 10-15 min walk -Downtown Crossing Station (Red line and Orange line): 10-15 min walk -Boylston Station (Green line): 10-15 min walk Driving: The good news about driving around here: the apartment is ideally located right where I-93 and I-90 meet  so it's pretty easy to hop right onto either highway. Also  since pretty much everything is close by  you won't have to spend too much time in the car (or on your cab fare). The bad news about driving around here: the apartment is in Boston. I really don't recommend driving in Boston if you can avoid it,14007443,Sarah,4/7/2014,100%,97%,t,Chinatown,Hudson Street  Boston  MA 02111  United States,Chinatown,2111,Apartment,Entire home/apt,4,2,2,2,179,2,5/27/2016,100,strict,0.44

4568116,Brownstone Cozy Private Studio,Logan Airport: A taxi is about 30 and the fastest way (unfortunately uberX/Lyft has been limited at the airport)  13 minutes without traffic. For public transportation take an airport shuttle bus from your terminal to the Airport T subway station (blue line). Travel in-bound to State T station where you will need to get off and switch to the orange line in-bound (to Forest Hills). Get off at Roxbury Crossing  take a right out of the station  cross Columbus Ave  and walk up the hill in 5 mins. T (subway/metro): The station is Roxbury Crossing and its the 3rd stop to Back Bay/Copley. Another 3 more stops form there takes you to Downtown Crossing. Hubway bike sharing: 6 for a 24 hour pass or 12 for a 72 hour pass. I highly recommend this as a way to discover the city. Right at the subway station outside you'll see these bikes and the station is located on Boston's longest bike and walking path  the Southwest Corridor Park. 10 mins to back bay  25 mins to Harvard Square.

6378076,Cozy 1 Bed in Historic Charlestown,Parking and Transportation Luckily the parking situation at my condo is very good for Boston.  Charlestown is free to park anywhere on weekends and holidays  but there is a street very close that it is okay to park always (On weekends its easy to park usually right in front of my place).  I cannot say enough how rare this is for Boston.  The name of this street is called Terminal St and is located very close to my place.  I can show you when you arrive if you'd like.  Boston however is not a driving city.  It is very difficult really see the cool things in Boston and drive to them.  For this I suggest using Uber.  It is very cheap to get all around the city.  If you have not signed up for it yet you can use my referral code and get some free rides around the city.  If visiting anything outside the city your car will be valuable  but again anything inside it can be as much as 30 dollars to park and Uber is a lot cheaper than that.

In addition  the speedy Boston commuter rail is accessible at the bottom of the hill at the corner of Park and Railroad Streets in a brisk 15 minute hike. See our Guidebook for these public transit stops and then use G00GLE Maps Transit to plan your routes from the corner of Park and Robin Streets. In addition  ride sharing options such as Uber  Lyft  and Fasten are very convenient alternatives  and fairly cost-competitive with public transportation when traveling in a group.,9241244,Keith (& Beth),10/5/2013,100%,95%,t,West Roxbury,Robin Street  Boston  MA 02132  United States,West Roxbury,2132,House,Private room,4,1,1,2,100,1,9/1/2016,100,flexible,2.11
9292118,Beautiful 2BD / 1 BA - 1st Floor,The apartment is 5 a minute walk from the West Roxbury Commuter Rail station and the 35 & 36 bus stop at Centre and Lorette St.  You can get to downtown Boston in 30 minutes on either one.  I personally prefer the Commuter Rail  as it is a very relaxing experience on the train compared to a bus. If you have a car  you can park on Temple Street  there are no meters or permits.  Please park as close to  driveway openings as possible  but do not block them.  This will maximize the number of cars that can be parked on the street and is very helpful to the neighbors!,2935501,John,7/14/2012,100%,100%,f,West Roxbury,Temple Street  West Roxbury  MA 02132  United States,West Roxbury,2132,Apartment,Entire home/apt,4,1,2,2,125,1,8/17/2016,96,strict,2.29

1391492,Quiet bedroom  quilts and parking,We are most convenient with a car and parking is included. About the public transit  if you go to the MBTA website and look up either the Fairmount or Providence/Stoughton lines  it will give you a better idea of how easy (or not) it will be to get to/from where you want to go  and how to get to our place from Logan. We are exactly 1 mile from both the Fairmount Commuter station and the Hyde Park Commuter station. Its not a bad walk  but the lines don't run as regularly as the inner T lines outside of rush hour. So  I would take a look and see if you think that would work for you and your sightseeing plans.,7523199,Alex,7/16/2013,100%,96%,t,Hyde Park,Dana Avenue  Boston  MA 02136  United States,Hyde Park,2136,House,Private room,2,1.5,1,1,55,2,8/27/2016,95,moderate,1.92

570493,2 Bedrms  2 Priv Bath&Priv Entrance,The very reliable and frequently running Red Line Subway is just under a 10 minute walk (Ashmont Station).  In addition there is a bus directly in front of my house which goes to Fields Corner (also on the Red Line  which is a convenient alternative if you don't want to walk to Ashmont or if the weather is bad).  Personally  I just always walk to Ashmont  and I'm on the platform in under 15 minutes from the minute I leave my front door. Cabs service in Boston is not very reliable and not easy to find in many locations except for the airport  train stations  and some subway stations.  I highly recommend  Uber for anyone who would otherwise think of using a taxi.  Poor taxi service in Boston has caused me to miss flights on 2 separate occasions.,914630,Bill,8/3/2011,100%,77%,t,Dorchester,Adams Street  Boston  MA 02124  United States,Dorchester,2124,House,Private room,4,2.5,1,2,125,1,8/28/2016,96,moderate,1.54

2843596,Perfect for BCEC!Free bike 3+ night,***Please inquire with me if you are interested in having us pick you up or drop you off from either South Station or the airport. We will provide a flat rate that is competitive with Uber/taxis in the area. But this needs to be arranged with me*** We're convenient to bus route 5 7 9 10  and 11! Lots of people also enjoy using Uber to get to BCEC or South Station  which runs 5-7.  Getting to our place from the airport is as simple as taking FREE shuttle bus SL1 to South Station. From there  you have a variety of options: -Take bus 7 or 11 toward City Point and get off at the O Street stop. -Take Uber  which from South Station runs about 5-7 (please double check this  as Uber rates sometimes fluctuate  and I have no control over that). Alternatively  you can take a cab or Uber straight from the airport. Prices for a cab from the airport usually run about 30 (again  I can't control traffic flow or Uber rates). You can also walk about 40-45minutes  if you're looking to get to the neare,3351569,Monique,8/23/2012,100%,100%,f,South Boston,East 4th Street  Boston  MA 02127  United States,South Boston,2127,Apartment,Private room,1,1.5,1,1,103,0,8/29/2016,95,moderate,2.8

5004278,Lovely Southie Apt w. amazing views,There are two main buses that travel through Southie: the #7 and the #9. The #9 bus stops at the top of H Street and East Broadway and will take you right into the South End neighborhood and Back Bay  both of which are very popular. Before it brings you to these areas though  it will stop at the Broadway T station where you can get on the redline subway and go wherever you'd like via train! It's a 1 mile walk to the Broadway T station if you prefer  and an additional 15 minutes into the South End.  The #7 bus stops at the corner of East Broadway and L street (about a 5 minute walk from the apartment) and it will take you through the Fort Point Channel/Seaport District and into Downtown Crossing and the Financial District downtown. Walking to Downtown Crossing will take you about 35 minutes if you prefer to walk.   If you plan on using the bus a good deal during your stay it would likely make sense to download a bus app on your phone so you know when the next one is coming.
