Islam managed pretty well our arrival, even if it was last minute ;) i do recommand this place to any airbnb user :)

1178162,5003196,6/6/2013,6449554,Sebastian,We really enjoyed our stay at Islams house. From the outside the house didn't look so inviting but the inside was very nice! Even though Islam himself was not there everything was prepared for our arrival. The airport T Station is only a 5-10 min walk away. The only little issue was that all the people in the house had to share one bathroom. But it was not really a problem and it worked out fine. We would recommend Islams place for a stay in Boston. ,,,,
