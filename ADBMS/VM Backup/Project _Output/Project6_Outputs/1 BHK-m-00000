Back Bay Station is three stops inbound. The E Branch of the Green Line is a 5-10 minute walk away. This segment of the Green Line is a street level train.  The 66 bus to Harvard Square stops just across the street from the Orange Line station. This bus is a great option if you'd like to visit Harvard Square  Coolidge Corner  Brookline  or Allston. PARKING INFORMATION: Parking is a finite resource in Boston. I do not want guests that are only interested in staying here just because of the parking. Please be aware that non-residents who park on my street make it harder for my neighbors to find a spot near their home. Leave your car at home  you don't need it here. I DO NOT recommend bringing a car to Boston  but parking is free on the street. I can not guarantee a parking space  but finding a spot is usually not a problem.

4568116,Brownstone Cozy Private Studio,Logan Airport: A taxi is about 30 and the fastest way (unfortunately uberX/Lyft has been limited at the airport)  13 minutes without traffic. For public transportation take an airport shuttle bus from your terminal to the Airport T subway station (blue line). Travel in-bound to State T station where you will need to get off and switch to the orange line in-bound (to Forest Hills). Get off at Roxbury Crossing  take a right out of the station  cross Columbus Ave  and walk up the hill in 5 mins. T (subway/metro): The station is Roxbury Crossing and its the 3rd stop to Back Bay/Copley. Another 3 more stops form there takes you to Downtown Crossing. Hubway bike sharing: 6 for a 24 hour pass or 12 for a 72 hour pass. I highly recommend this as a way to discover the city. Right at the subway station outside you'll see these bikes and the station is located on Boston's longest bike and walking path  the Southwest Corridor Park. 10 mins to back bay  25 mins to Harvard Square.

I'd recommend an Uber or UberX (25-35).  Another option is to take the MBTA.  The silver line (which is actually a bus) leaves Logan airport and you'll want to get off at South Station. From there  you'll want to take the red line to Park street (towards Alewife) to switch to the green line.  Take Park street on the green line towards B  C  D  or E (any of those lines will work) and get off at Arlington.  We're about an 8 block walk from the Arlington MBTA station. The MBTA or the T - Green line  Arlington Station - is 5 minutes away (8-9 blocks). A one-way T subway ride is 2.65 if you get a paper ticket. At some of the larger T stations  you can get a plastic Charlie Card and add money via the machines. This makes a one way T ride 2.10.

6378076,Cozy 1 Bed in Historic Charlestown,Parking and Transportation Luckily the parking situation at my condo is very good for Boston.  Charlestown is free to park anywhere on weekends and holidays  but there is a street very close that it is okay to park always (On weekends its easy to park usually right in front of my place).  I cannot say enough how rare this is for Boston.  The name of this street is called Terminal St and is located very close to my place.  I can show you when you arrive if you'd like.  Boston however is not a driving city.  It is very difficult really see the cool things in Boston and drive to them.  For this I suggest using Uber.  It is very cheap to get all around the city.  If you have not signed up for it yet you can use my referral code and get some free rides around the city.  If visiting anything outside the city your car will be valuable  but again anything inside it can be as much as 30 dollars to park and Uber is a lot cheaper than that.

12493396,One-BR Apt in Heart of Beacon Hill,It is easiest to get around this part of Boston by walking  Uber/Taxi or the T (near MGH Station/Red Line).  If you have a car  there is a small no-parking area on the corner of Myrtle and Grove that is convenient for quick drop-offs at the apartment  however it is a no parking/tow zone - and they do ticket and tow often both around the apartment and in the neighborhood in general.  There is no visitor parking in the Beacon Hill neighborhood outside of metered parking on Charles St  which is extremely difficult to come by.  Longer-term parking can be found in garages outside the Beacon Hill neighborhood in downtown Boston  which is walkable or a short taxi ride.  Hertz car-rental is on Cambridge St (down the street  a five minute walk)  and ZipCar has vehicles available in the Charles River Parking Garage behind Au Bon Pain.

9107357,An Elegant Condo in Beacon Hill,Foot: Keep in mind you are in an excellent location.  If the weather is nice  I highly recommend walking as much as possible.  The Boston Common  Public Gardens  Charles St  Newbury St  and Boylston St are all within walking distance.  This means excellent dining  shopping  entertainment  and sightseeing are all accessible by foot.  Also  bicycles can be rented and dropped off at kiosks all around the city. PUBLIC TRANSPORT: The closet T station to the Condo is the Charles/MGH (Red Line) station.  You can access the entire city from this subway/bus hub. How to Walk there: A short 4 min [0.25 mi] walk with 1 turn: -Go EAST on Pinckney Street towards Charles Street -Take a LEFT onto Charles St -Travel NORTH on Charles Street and the station will be straight ahead -- PERSONAL CAR: PARKING: Parking can tricky & expensive in Boston. The easiest solutions for first-time travelers are parking garages. The most convenient garage for this location is the Boston Common Parking Garage.

2915595,Penthouse in the heart of Fenway!,Or  if you don't feel like walking  there are 3 green line T stops within a 5 minute walk of our place  Fenway  St. Mary's  and Kenmore. The green line will take you to most tourist destination such as Faneuil Hall (Haymarket stop)  the North End (Haymarket or North Station stop)  or the Public Garden/Copley Sq (Arlington stop). Boston is also super Uber/Lyft friendly  generally an Uber takes less than 3 minutes to arrive to pick up at our condo. Depending on the part of the city you are traveling to I would expect to pay anywhere from 5-13.  Getting here from the airport - You can choose to take a taxi (usually around a 25 ride)  or take the T for a 2.00 ride per person. To take the T you have to take the Silver line from the airport to South Station  where you will take the Red line inbound to Park St  and switch to the Green line towards Kenmore. You may get off at Kenmore and walk up Beacon St about 5 minutes to reach the condo building.  Parking - can normally be difficult,14889768,Danielle And Cory,4/29/2014,100%,100%,f,Fenway/Kenmore,Beacon Street  Boston  MA 02215  United States,Fenway,2215,Apartment,Entire home/apt,2,1,1,1,299,1,7/25/2016,98,moderate,1.73

We are exactly 1 mile from both the Fairmount Commuter station and the Hyde Park Commuter station. Its not a bad walk  but the lines don't run as regularly as the inner T lines outside of rush hour.

From there  you have a variety of options: -Take bus 7 or 11 toward City Point and get off at the O Street stop. -Take Uber  which from South Station runs about 5-7 (please double check this  as Uber rates sometimes fluctuate  and I have no control over that). Alternatively  you can take a cab or Uber straight from the airport. Prices for a cab from the airport usually run about 30 (again  I can't control traffic flow or Uber rates).

5004278,Lovely Southie Apt w. amazing views,There are two main buses that travel through Southie: the #7 and the #9. The #9 bus stops at the top of H Street and East Broadway and will take you right into the South End neighborhood and Back Bay  both of which are very popular. Before it brings you to these areas though  it will stop at the Broadway T station where you can get on the redline subway and go wherever you'd like via train! It's a 1 mile walk to the Broadway T station if you prefer  and an additional 15 minutes into the South End.  The #7 bus stops at the corner of East Broadway and L street (about a 5 minute walk from the apartment) and it will take you through the Fort Point Channel/Seaport District and into Downtown Crossing and the Financial District downtown. Walking to Downtown Crossing will take you about 35 minutes if you prefer to walk.   If you plan on using the bus a good deal during your stay it would likely make sense to download a bus app on your phone so you know when the next one is coming.
