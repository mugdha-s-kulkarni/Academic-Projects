Near airport, city, subway!","Our home is a five minute walk from the Airport or Maverick subway stops on the Blue Line, which is great for getting anywhere in a Boston or Cambridge. The subway system in Boston is safe and commonly used by the city's kids and college students as well as older professionals. If you're coming here from the airport, the easiest way is definitely to take the Blue Line from whichever terminal you're at (it stops outside each terminal every 10-15 minutes) and take it to the MBTA Blue Line Airport stop. From there just walk 5 minutes to our place and you'll be in your temporary home! It should take no more than 10-15 minutes from when you leave the terminal to get to our house. There is street parking available for all guests every day, and there should be no trouble finding a 2-hour parking spot in this quiet neighborhood as there is visitor parking on most streets here.

Charlestown is free to park anywhere on weekends and holidays, but there is a street very close that it is okay to park always (On weekends its easy to park usually right in front of my place).  I cannot say enough how rare this is for Boston.  The name of this street is called Terminal St and is located very close to my place.  I can show you when you arrive if you'd like.  Boston however is not a driving city.  It is very difficult really see the cool things in Boston and drive to them.  For this I suggest using Uber.  It is very cheap to get all around the city.  If you have not signed up for it yet you can use my referral code and get some free rides around the city.  If visiting anything outside the city your car will be valuable, but again anything inside it can be as much as 30 dollars to park and Uber is a lot cheaper than that.

5004278,Lovely Southie Apt w. amazing views,"There are two main buses that travel through Southie: the #7 and the #9. The #9 bus stops at the top of H Street and East Broadway and will take you right into the South End neighborhood and Back Bay, both of which are very popular. Before it brings you to these areas though, it will stop at the Broadway T station where you can get on the redline subway and go wherever you'd like via train! It's a 1 mile walk to the Broadway T station if you prefer, and an additional 15 minutes into the South End.  The #7 bus stops at the corner of East Broadway and L street (about a 5 minute walk from the apartment) and it will take you through the Fort Point Channel/Seaport District and into Downtown Crossing and the Financial District downtown. Walking to Downtown Crossing will take you about 35 minutes if you prefer to walk.   If you plan on using the bus a good deal during your stay it would likely make sense to download a bus app on your phone so you know when the next one is coming.
